designing an electrical circuit for eye control
Used equipments: 
Arduino Uno R3
2 led 
2 transistor
Firstly; we connect a wire from the cathode transistor to the Arduino Uno R3 GND
Secondly; we connected a wire from the Arduino Uno R3 DIGITAL (PWM) to terminal 1 of the transistor and a wire from terminal 2 to the Anode led
We do the same for led 2
